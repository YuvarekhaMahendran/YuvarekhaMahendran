## Hi there 👋

👐Yuvarekha, a dedicated graduate student, is committed to acquiring new skills and knowledge to achieve her goals.

🎓In my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering, I developed proficiency in HTML, CSS, SQL, and Python. A compelling coursework on "Industrial Economics and Corporate Management" during my 8th semester inspired me to pursue Business Analytics as my next step. 

🪄I further enhanced my skills with online certification in "The Joy of Computing using Python" by NPTEL and gained practical experience through a business analytics internship. Additional certifications from Coursera includes Fundamentals of Visualization with Tableau, Data Scientist’s Toolbox, IBM Data Analyst Professional Certification, Forage-Quantium data analytics job simulation and Accenture-North America's data analysis and visualisation job simulation. Additionally, with an immense zeal in finance domain, I gained certification in Corporate Finance foundations through LinkedIn Learning.

📚Motivated by this, I am currently pursuing a Master's in Business Analytics, envisioning it as a transformative step in my career. My ability to comprehend real-time industrial datasets and meticulous investigative approach, combined with my Master's education, empowers me to practically apply knowledge for business needs. The coursework, spanning R, SAS, Tableau, Excel, Python, Statistics, Big Data, and Accounting, SQL expands my skill set.

📈Recently contributing to an IBM Data Analyst Professional Certification capstone project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis on the "2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey," utilizing Python, MS Excel, and SQL. 

🕰️This experience further fueled my desire to work in future as a business analyst, data analyst, data scientist and financial analyst aligning with my career goals.
